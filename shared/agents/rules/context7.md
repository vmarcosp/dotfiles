When working with libraries, frameworks, or APIs — use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation instead of relying on training data. This includes setup questions, code generation, API references, and anything involving specific packages.

## Steps

1. Call `resolve-library-id` with the library name and the user's question
2. Pick the best match — prefer exact names and version-specific IDs when a version is mentioned
3. Call `query-docs` with the selected library ID and the user's question
4. Answer using the fetched docs — include code examples and cite the version
